TXTDirect types can work together to redirect or proxy the requests with more complex logic. For example, the `path` type can be combined with all of the other types so you can redirect the requests based on their path to different zones with different types.

All of the possible scenarios that different types can be combined are listed under the [Combination](/docs/examples/combination) category.
