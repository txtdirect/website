TXTDirect is using DNS TXT records to store data and keeps you in control of your own data.

In the examples "txtdirect.example.com" is your hosted TXTDirect instance.

It is recommended to use CNAMEs to reference this instance, where possible.

These are simplified examples.  
For an overview of the full TXT record configuration take a look at our [specification](/docs/specification/).
