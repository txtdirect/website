# General Requirements

## TXT record

- Record must not exceed 255 characters
- Record key-value pairs must be delimited by semicolons ";"
- Key and value must be encoded using utf8
- Punycode for domain names should be used
- Ordering key-value pairs can be done
- Arbitrary data/non key-value pairs can be used and will be ignored

## Location/Zone

- TXT record must be accessible under the subdomain "\_redirect"

## URLs

- All URLs must be encoded
- ";" must be escaped as "%3B"

Examples:

```; -> %3B
? -> %3F
= -> %3D
https://example.com/page/about=us -> https://example.com/page/about%3Dus
```

Further links about URL encoding:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding  
https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#page-11

## Multipart Records

TXT records that are longer than 255 characters should be split into multiple parts.
As mentioned in [RFC4408](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4408), "A single text DNS record can be composed of more than one string.
If a published record contains multiple strings, then the record MUST be treated as if those strings are concatenated together without adding spaces".
Example:

```
_redirect.multipart.example.com     3600 IN TXT    "v=txtv0;type=host" "code=301" "to=https://txtdirect.org"
```

## Cache Headers

TXTDirect adds an `Cache-Control` header with duration of 1 week by default
to all `301` redirects.
Since a `301` status code is for permanent redirects, most clients might
not refresh their cache without specifying an `Cache-Control` header on `301` redirects.  
It's recommended to always add a `Cache-Control` header with at least a duration of a day
or a week to all `301` redirects.

# Host Type

## Description

`host` is the most simple type. Using `host` you can redirect an incoming request to a specific endpoint with a custom status code defined in the TXT record.
For example records you can check [host](https://about.txtdirect.org/docs/examples/#host).

## Record fields

**Type**

- Key: **type**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "host"
- Example: "type=host"

**Version**

- Key: **v**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "txtv0"
- Example: "v=txtv0"

**Redirect URL**

- Key: **to**
- Recommended
- Default: Fallback to **www** or **redirect** config
- Permitted values: "absolute|relative URL"
- Example: "to=https://example.com"
- Example: "to=/example/"

**Redirect Code**

- Key: **code**
- Optional
- Default: "302"
- Permitted values: "301|302"
- Example: "code=301"

---

# Path Type

## Description

Sometimes you may need to redirect a request coming into a single host/domain to separate locations based on the request's path. One common use-case is a URL shortener.
`path` type extracts each directory by default. Each directory is used to generate a new sub zone to fetch the TXT record from. To reorder the default order you can use the `from=` field.

`path` also contains some additional configuration to process the request's path. The `re=` field enables use of a custom regex to control which data is used to construct the sub zones, where TXT record data is fetched.

`path` uses `\/([A-Za-z0-9-._~!$'()*+,;=:@]+)` as the default regex to parse
the request's path. The matches from this regex would get used to construct the sub zones
and they're also available as numbered regex [placeholders](/docs/placeholders).

### Path Sanitization

To use the request's path for generating the zone address it needs to be normalized into allowed DNS chars. For example `.`(dot) is replaced with `-`(dash) to keep each match in its own zone. You can visit [RFC1034](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1034) for more information about the allowed chars.

The request's path is used to construct the zone address, which provides the redirect data used for this specific path. By default each directory is extracted and the order reverted meaning the less specific zone will come first:
`example.com/firstDirectory/secondDirectory/ -> secondDirectory.firstDirectory.example.com`
A custom ordering can be achieved by using the `from=` field. It will reorder the sub zones accordingly.
If a custom regex is configured with the `re=` field each match is used as a sub zone. Ordering can be modified by using named matches. The default ordering will use the first match as the first sub zone and continue until there are no new matches.

## Wildcards

If a specific record is non-existent it will fallback to a wildcard record, if available.
Wildcard records can be set using `_` such as `_redirect._.path.example.com`.  
_For non-existent zones or catch-all use-cases a [general wildcard](#wildcard-records) can be used._

For example look at these sample records:

```
_redirect.path.example.test.      IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=path;code=302;to=https://about.txtdirect.org/docs/specification/#path-type"
_redirect._.path.example.test.      IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=host;code=302;to=https://about.txtdirect.org/docs/specification/#wildcards"
```

If the incoming request's path isn't empty it will get redirected to wildcard record's `to=` field. But if the request doesn't have a path, it gets redirected to the first record's `to=` field.

```
https://path.example.test -> https://about.txtdirect.org/docs/specification/#path-type
https://path.example.test/wildcards -> https://about.txtdirect.org/docs/specification/#wildcards
```

### Multi-level wildcards

Wildcard records can have more than just one placeholder and be multi-level. By default the incoming request's path would get reversed and then used to generate a zone address. For example if the request's path is `/first/second` the resulting zone address would be `second.first.host.tld`.
The order can be custimzed using a simplified regex aka the `from=` field. For example look at these sample records:

```
_redirect.path.example.test.      IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=path;code=302;from=/$2/$1;to=https://parent.example.test"

_redirect._.first.path.example.test.      IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=host;code=302;to=https://first.example.test"
_redirect._.second.path.example.test.      IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=host;code=302;to=https://second.example.test"
_redirect._._.path.example.test.      IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=host;code=302;to=https://nothing.example.test"
```

Now if the incoming request's path is `/first/second` it would use the `_redirect._.second.path.example.test` record and get redirected to `https://second.example.test`. That's because we used the `/$2/$1` regex for the parent path record's `from=` field. Also if the request's path is `/second/first` it would use the `_redirect._.first.path.example.test` record.

If the request's path is neither of those cases, it would then use the last wildcard record. So if the request's path for example is `/not/available`, it would use the `_redirect._._.path.example.test` record and get redirected to `https://nothing.example.test`.

# Dockerv2 Type

## Description

The `dockerv2` type enables vanity URLs for your container images. Using your own URl for container images enables easier switching between your backend infrastructure/storage and adds more control.
The type implements the Docker registry API v2 and redirects requests for both metadata and image blobs to the backend storage. All data besides the redirect is therefore served by your underlying infrastructure such as Google Container Registry (gcr.io).

The upstream endpoint used for `to=` can be different depending on the use case.

1. Image link including a specific tag enables serving this specific tag under various image names and tags.
2. Image link enables serving available tags for a specific image under various image names.
3. Referencing the root of a container registry enables the full serving of the registry under this specific domain.

## Record Fields

**Type**

- Key: **type**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "dockerv2"
- Example: "type=dockerv2"

**Version**

- Key: **v**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "txtv0"
- Example: "v=txtv0"

**Backend URL**

- Key: **to**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "absolute registry URL"
- Note: "For non-container traffic it will fallback to _website_, _www_ or _redirect_ config"
- Example: "to=https://gcr.io/" _pass through namespaces, container and tag_
- Example: "to=https://gcr.io/txtdirect/container" _pass through tag_
- Example: "to=https://gcr.io/txtdirect/container:tag" _force specific tag_

**Website Redirect URL**

- Key: **website**
- Recommended
- Default: Fallback to **www** or **redirect** config
- Note: "Non container traffic redirect"
- Permitted values: "absolute|relative URL"
- Example: "to=https://about.txtdirect.org/docs/"

# Gometa Type

## Description

The `gometa` type enables vanity URLs for your Go packages. Using your own URL for packages, enables easier switching between your backend hosting service (GitHub, etc.) and lets you have custom import path for your package, independent of your hosting service. Using `gometa` you can switch your hosting service without worrying about impacting downstream for your users.
Using `gometa` type you can point to a Go package inside your records using the `to=` field and we use that URI to generate a simple HTML page that only contains go-import and go-source **(Only for packages served on GitHub)** tags for `go get` to use it and find your package.

## Record fields

**Type**

- Key: **type**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "gometa"
- Example: "type=gometa"

**Version**

- Key: **v**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "txtv0"
- Example: "v=txtv0"

**Backend URL**

- Key: **to**
- Recommended
- Default: Fallbacks such as **www** or **redirect** config
  <!--* Note: "For non container traffic it will fallback to *website*, *www* or *redirect* config"-->
- Permitted values: "absolute repository URL"
- Example: "to=https://github.com/txtdirect/"
- Example: "to=/docs/"

<!--
**Website Redirect URL**

* Key: **website**
* Recommended
* Default: Fallback to **www** or **redirect** config
* Note: "Non gometa traffic redirect"
* Permitted values: "absolute|relative URL"

**Type**

- Key: **type**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "proxy"
- Example: "type=proxy"

**Version**

- Key: **v**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "txtv0"

**Upstream URL**

- Key: **to**
- Mandatory
- Permitted values: "absolute URL"
- Example: "to=https://example.com/subpage/"

# Wildcard Records

A wildcard DNS record is a record in a DNS zone that will match requests for non-existent domain names. For example you can specify a record that matches all the subdomains that don't have a specific TXT record.

_NOTE: Using a CNAME record for the wildcard is not supported and will lead to wrong behaviour_

Take a look at these sample records:

```
; NOTE: Using a CNAME record for the wildcard is not supported and will lead to wrong behaviour
*.example.test.                    IN A   127.0.0.1
_redirect._.example.test.          IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=host;code=302;to=http://wildcard.test"

; NOTE: Specific records can use a CNAME or A/AAAA records.
specific.example.test              IN A   127.0.0.1
_redirect.specific.example.test.   IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=host;code=302;to=http://specific.test"
```

All the requests for a given subdomain of `example.test` such as `test.example.test` would use the wildcard record of the parent zone `_redirect._.example.test`.
In the case a more specific record is available it will take be used.  
For a specific record to work a specific subdomain needs to be setup as well. This is based on DNS specifics.
With `specific.example.test` and `_redirect.specific.example.test` set it will be used instead of the above wildcard.

The redirect flow for these records would look like this:

```
specific.example.test -> http://specific.test
*.example.test        -> http://wildcard.test
```

# Custom Headers

Custom headers can be added to the responses with specifing them inside the records. For example to add a HSTS header to the responses you can use the following example:

```
_redirect.example.test.   IN TXT "v=txtv0;type=host;to=http://example.test;>Strict-Transport-Security=>Strict-Transport-Security=max-age%3D163072000%3B%20includeSubDomains%3B%20preload"
```

You can separate the headers just like the other record fields by using `;`.  
Also the custom headers would get added to the records that are chained to a `path` record. For example:

```
"_redirect.example.test.": "v=txtv0;type=path;>Test=TestValue"
"_redirect.second.example.test.": "v=txtv0;type=host;to=https://example.test"
```

The `second.example.test` record would also have the `Test` header in this example.

**Important Note:** Since headers can contain characters that can interrupt the
record parser, [urlencoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) is required for the header values.

Also custom headers will overwrite the previous headers that were added to the
responses. like the headers from the Caddyfile.
